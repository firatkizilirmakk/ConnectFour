# ConnectFour
    A simple connect four game made for winter project given in Gebze Technical University,CSE department.
There are two playing modes,person vs person and person vs computer.
For computer moves,minimax algorithm with alpha-beta-pruning is used(at least tried :) ).
There is also a timed mode in which time set at the beginning by player where player must make a move
before the time expires,otherwise computer makes a move randomly for the user.

Some screenshots from the game :
